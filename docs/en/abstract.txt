Broadcast data events to multiple clients connected through tcp sockets. Since \
PHPÂ´s lifecycle is rather short lived node.js helps to keep client connections \
alive. That means your clients talk to the foomo webserver as usually and in \
addition they connect to a node.js server through a tcp connections, that is \
being kept open for the whole lifetime of the client process.

When you want to broadcast sth. to the connected clients the foomo webserver \
opens a second socket to the node.js server and lets it distribute data events.
